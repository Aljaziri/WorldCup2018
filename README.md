## Motivation for the Project
It would be interesting to verify our personal observation during the World Cup based on real data taken from FIFA. The purpose of this project is to follow data science process to answer presented questions.

## Main Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib

## Files in the Repository
- FIFA WORLD CUP 2018 Players.ipynb : notebook that has the code used for the analysis
- wc2018-players.csv : data file selected for the analysis

## Summary of the Results of the Analysis
Measurements that FIFA is recording for the players have limitations. To reflect the real physical status of players, other measurements must be tracked. Modern scales can measure things like fat mass, water mass, and muscle mass.
